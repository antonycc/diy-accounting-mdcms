DIY Accounting and payroll software Support

# description
<p>DIY Accounting's spreadsheet packages are supported and maintained using an Open Source model. In return for allowing anyone access to our source files, we find an indefinite low cost home at GitHub. We continue to keep the website up with downloads for up-to-date packages. This model relies upon community support (an online forum) and accepting donations instead of retaining paid staff and charging a fee.<br/>
